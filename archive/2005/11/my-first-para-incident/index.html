				<div class="post-entry">
					<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>You might have not noticed, but in my spare time I am an avid (albeit distinctly amateur) <a href="http://jim.webber.name/2004/08/02/7cddd0d2-1b00-4c7b-9ca0-b4e7b15d6da8.aspx">paraglider pilot</a>. I was thrilled today that for the first time in about four months I was finally able to take to the air at my local site down at <a href="http://flystanwell.com">Stanwell Park</a>.</p>
<p>The day was wonderfully warm and sunny, the sky peppered with a few friendly looking puffy clouds. On arrival, the air seemed good, light-ish but solid ESE which is perfect for that site. After watching a couple of other paragliders take to the air and scoot around for a while (<em>rule number 1: <u>never</u> be first in the air</em>) I duly took a few minutes to get off terra firma by way of a reasonable (given I&#8217;ve been out of action for so long) reverse launch.</p>
<p>So far so good, the wind was light but heading north from launch a few hundred metres up the beatiful New South Wales coast back towards Sydney there was some lift to be had and only one other glider to share this 300m stretch of ridge with &#8211; excellent! This particular ridge is comprised from steep cliffs tapering off into bushes at about a 25-45 degree angle before turning back into steep cliffs and heading straight down to the sea. I have often flown over this ridge and admired how spectacular the scenary is.</p>
<p>However the wind abruptly stopped about 20 minutes into my flight. Initially I had planned to make it back to the launch area but upon returning south to launch I entered an area of sinking air which had me heading towards the cliffs with no hope of making either a top landing or of making it down to the safety of Stanwell beach. Instead I had to search for an alternative landing site, and my only real option available to me at that time was a clearing of around 4m by 3m on part of the cliffs at around a 30 degree angle. Not nice.</p>
<p>The landing went pretty smoothly, although my glider did get snagged on a few bushes after I collapsed it. Quick check revealed all my limbs were in-tact and that I wasn&#8217;t in any immediate danger of falling down the cliffside, but I had ended up in a pretty inaccessible place pondering just how I was going to walk out. A quick call to Mark Mitsos (the local chief flying instructor from <a href="http://www.sydneyparagliding.com/">Syndey Paragliding</a>) to try to establish the best way to walk out followed. Tony from the Stanwell club quickly took over and we switched from mobile phone to radio to establish my position (which wasn&#8217;t visible from the clifftops or the beach) and to figure out the best way of getting me off the cliffs and back on the flat.</p>
<p>After having realised that I was ridiculously off the beaten path, Tony came trudging through the bushes and undergrowth towards me, and I began trudging (panting, wheezing, cursing) through various bits of undergrowth not really getting anywhere and getting ridiculously thirsty. After half an hour of trying to navigate through the undergrowth and trying to figure out how to rendezvous with Tony, I tried a different tack &#8211; back up the cliff to where I landed and heading south higher up where the vegetation was a little less dense. After an hour and a half of battling through the cliffs, falling, and touching plants that I now know not to (why do Australian nettles have to be so poisonous?), I finally made line of sight with Tony &#8211; much to my relief. Another 30-40 minutes of scrambling down some steep hillside to his position and battling through more undergrowth brought us within a few metres of each other &#8211; close enough for him to throw me a bottle of Ribena which was very welcome indeed.</p>
<p>After clearing a couple more lumps of dense undergrowth we found our way to the track (in the loosest sense of the word) and began to head back towards Stanwell. Tony, ever the gentleman, could see that I was totally knackered and took my glider for the 20 minute up-and-down the cliffside walk back to his 4&#215;4. From there it was a simple job of sitting in air conditioned splendour and getting back up the hill.</p>
<p>After slurping a few bottles of water, I discovered that two other pilots had also been caught out by the fickle wind today. One, another paraglider pilot, had also made it to a safe landing and a long (but largely wildlife free) walk from a nearby village. Another pilot in a hang-glider had not been so lucky. He had crashed his glider in almost exactly the same position as me and had to leap from his craft shortly before it plummeted to the bushes below, leaving him stranded on the cliffside. That pilot had to be rescued by Tony (isn&#8217;t he a gem?) and a long winch cable to bring him back up the cliffs. Back at launch Neil helped me check my glider for damage (thankfully none) and get my equipment back to some semblance of normality.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned a few things from this incident. Firstly I now know to always fly with a couple of litres of water on hot days, even if it adds to the laden weight of the glider. Secondly I&#8217;ve learned that the wind is fickle and I should always have an escape plan should my current flight path be compromised, rather than making one up once the problem has arisen. Thirdly Tony shared some tips on better places to bomb-out which don&#8217;t involve getting friendly with the native (evil) fauna, which I will use if I have to again (which I learn is probably since even as a much more advanced pilot, Tony bombs-out now and again too). Perhaps most importantly to me this time around was to always carry a radio and to always make sure it&#8217;s charged &#8211; I would have been in some trouble had I opted not to carry one today.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m sitting at home nursing a few rotten cuts from the walk-out (no injuries during the landing) and wondering when the evil nettle stings will die down. Google tells me it&#8217;ll be in a week or so just when I&#8217;m ready to take to the air again :-)</p>
