		<description><![CDATA[@Maarten

I can give my view of what would be useful. There&#039;s probably some overlap with that and what will ship with Neo4j in the 2.x series. Off the top of my head:

1. Property exists constraints. E.g. for a label :Person, there must be first_name and last_name properties present on that node.
2. Structural constraints. E.g. if a node has a label :Car then it must be connected via an incoming :DRIVES relationship to at least one other node with label :Person.

Hope that&#039;s useful.
