		<description><![CDATA[Hi Karen,

My i3 (22kWh) plus Rex gives me about 140 miles. But as I understand it, the US version of the car has a smaller petrol tank and it doesn&#039;t have the charge-hold function that enables the driver to deliberately use the Rex for better long journey planning.

Having said that, I think the newer versions of the i3 have 33kWh batteries which even with a slightly smaller Rex could easily see you do a 120 mile trip.

I&#039;ve never exchanged my i3 for a fossil car: I have an old Prius that I use for any long trips.

		<description><![CDATA[Jim
Thats so funny.  Your origtinal post was about why you would never buy a BMW i3....and it ends 3 months later with you buying one.  So ....what happened?  and do you have any follow ups now, almost 3 years later?  
thanks,

thinking of taking the plunge but I am overly concerned about range.  we like to drive from our home to disney now and then....a 120mile trip...but BMW said we can exchange our i3 for an x3 x5 for no charge 14 days every year...?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi @Mark,

See: https://jimwebber.org/2015/10/plugin-hybrid-test-drives-electric-boogaloo/

I went with the i3 REX. I concur with you on the tech, but I think BMW&#039;s business practices are such that they&#039;ll compel a full upgrade once the finance period runs out. 

In fact that&#039;s the only negative I have: BMW&#039;s sales practices and obfuscation of model/world/options is frustrating compared to, say, Toyota.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jim,

Any luck with your EV hunt? 

My wife and I also loved the BMW i3 for the same reasons you pointed out.  Our reasoning for the purchase was simply this:  my wife&#039;s commute is about 60 miles (100km) a day.  With our BMW X3 and/or our van, our gas bill neared 400/month ($C)  This has now been completely eliminated.  Granted, there are times she will do groceries on the way back and dips into the Rex.  And when I say dip, it&#039;s a 2 dollar dip.  

In fact, for about 98% of our driving (friends, family, gymnastics, groceries, work, etc) this car is our first choice.

I understand we now have a car payment but at least it isn&#039;t going to some gas company but rather into probably one of the most technologically advanced vehicles on the road.  



My prediction in 10 years when I will need to replace the batteries the conversation will go something like this:  Hi Veteran BMW i3 driver,  we could put the same 22 kWh battery in for 5-6k or you could replace it with the current technology which is a 150 kWh battery giving you a range of 500-700 km.  Oh yes, by the way, since the car is carbon fibre and plastics, it will never rust so enjoy your car for another 10 + years.  

I am probably being a bit optimistic with technology but you get the gist.

Thought to share a different perspective.  Cheers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] There are also some architectural and hardware-based options.  The commercially licensed version of Neo4j offers the possibility of master-slave replication for horizontal read-scaling, and a technique called cache-sharding can be used which increases the chance of required data being queued up in main memory.  There are more details on that here.
